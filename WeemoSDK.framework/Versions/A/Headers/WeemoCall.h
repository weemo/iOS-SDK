 * The Video views autorotates with the interface and following the interface rotation rules set by the Host App. However, the outgoing video stream rotates with the device. This allow the outgoing video to be shown with a correct rotation within the receiving device, even if the user sending the video is holding the device using a rotation not supported by the Host App.
